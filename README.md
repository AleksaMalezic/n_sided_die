# N sided die simulation
This is a C++ die rolling simulator. This project provides a simple and entertaining way to simulate rolling die using C++. Whether you're a programming enthusiast looking to explore C++ or just want to have some virtual die-rolling fun, this program is a great starting point.
## Description and tutorial on how to use the project
- In this project you can roll any die you want, any times.
- You can use it by cloning the repository and running it on your local IDE.
- When you run the program, you will be asked how many sides does the die have, you should any input positive integer number.
- After that, you will be asked to imput number of times you want your die to be rolled, with the same restriction as above.
- If you choose to roll 6-side die once, you will get a visual representation of it. 
- However, if you want roll it multiple times, you will get results of every throw with the average value afterwards. 
- Feel free to contribute and review this project. ðŸŽ²
- I run this code using Visual Studio. You can compile it using cmd on windows or using terminal on Mac and Linux.
