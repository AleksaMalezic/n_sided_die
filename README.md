# n_sided_die
This is a C++ dice rolling simulator. 
You can choose the number of sides and how many times do you want to roll the dice. 
If you chose to roll once, you will get a visual representation of a dice. 
However, if you roll it multiple times, you will get the average value. 
Feel free to contribute and review the project. ðŸŽ²
